**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis using RFM**

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on an E-Commerce dataset. The analysis segments customers based on their purchasing behavior to enable personalized marketing strategies and predict future buying behaviors.

**Introduction**

RFM analysis is a method used for analyzing customer value and segmenting customers. This segmentation enables personalized marketing strategies, targeted communication, and helps in predicting future buying behaviors. RFM stands for:

_Recency_: How recently did the customer purchase?

_Frequency_: How often do they purchase?

_Monetary Value_: How much do they spend?

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this analysis is an E-Commerce dataset, which includes detailed information on customer transactions.

**Features:**

_InvoiceNo_: Invoice number.

_StockCode_: Product code.

_Description_: Product description.

_Quantity_: The quantity of each product per transaction.

_InvoiceDate_: Invoice date.

__UnitPrice_: Unit price of the product.

_CustomerID_: Unique identifier for each customer.

**Key Insights**

_Customer Segments_: The analysis segments customers into three main categories: Platinum, Gold, and Silver based on their purchasing behavior.

_Optimal Clustering_: The Elbow method suggests an optimal number of clusters to ensure meaningful segmentation.

_High-Value Customers_: Platinum customers show high frequency and monetary value, indicating they are the most valuable.

_Data Standardization_: Standardizing the RFM values ensures that clustering algorithms perform optimally.




_Country_: Country name.

_TotalSum_: Total amount spent on each transaction.
